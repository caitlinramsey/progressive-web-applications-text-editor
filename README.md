## Description
Just Another Text Editor is a single-page progressive web application where a user can create notes and/or code snippets with or without an internet connection. The application features a number of data persistence techniques which serve as redundancy in case the user's browser does not support one of the options. The user can retrieve their notes or snippets at any time for later use. Through the use of the integrated service worker as well as the cache APIs, it is guaranteed that the application will be fully functional with or without an internet connection. The user has the ability to access visited pages while offline.
